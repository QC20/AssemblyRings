# Assembly Rings - Interactive 3D Animation

Welcome to the **Assembly Rings** repository! This project is a captivating blend of interaction design and creative coding, aimed at showcasing the mesmerizing possibilities of 3D animations within web environments.

## Overview

**Assembly Rings** is an interactive 3D animation that consists of multiple rotating rings and dots, creating a visually stunning torus-like structure. This project explores the intersections of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles and creative coding, emphasizing user engagement through dynamic visual effects.

## Features

- **Dynamic 3D Animation**: Utilizing CSS animations and JavaScript to create a seamless and continuous rotating effect.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the animation looks great on all screen sizes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Encouraging user interaction and engagement with the visual representation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you'll need:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/assembly-rings.git
    cd assembly-rings
    ```

2. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser to see the animation in action.

### Customization

Feel free to tweak the parameters in the `styles.css` and `index.html` files to explore different visual effects. Here are some variables you can experiment with:

- **Number of Rings and Dots**: Adjust the `nrings` and `ndots` variables in the `index.html` script.
- **Animation Speed and Style**: Modify the animation properties in the `styles.css` file to create unique motion effects.

## Interaction Design Insights

This project is more than just an animationâ€”it's an exploration of how users interact with and perceive digital art. By manipulating 3D transformations and animations, we delve into:

- **User Engagement**: Creating an immersive experience that captivates and retains user attention.
- **Perception and Cognition**: Understanding how motion and 3D effects can influence user perception and cognitive load.
- **Aesthetics and Usability**: Balancing visual appeal with seamless interaction to enhance the overall user experience.
